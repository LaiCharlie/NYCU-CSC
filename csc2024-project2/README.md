# CSC Project2 - MITM and Pharming Attacks in Wi-Fi Networks

## Tasks: MITM and Pharming

### MITM Attack (60%)
 
> 1. **Task I: 20%**  
    Obtain all other client devicesâ€™ IP/MAC addresses in a connected Wi-Fi network  
> 2. **Task II: 15%**  
    ARP spoofing for all other client devices in the Wi-Fi network  
> 3. **Task III: 15%**  
    Fetch the inputted username/password strings from HTTP sessions  
> 4. **(10%)** One implementation question during the demo 

### Pharming Attack (40%)

> 1. Obtain all other client devicesâ€™ IP/MAC addresses in a connected Wi-Fi network  
> 2. **Task IV: 30%**  
    DNS spoofing attack for web services  
> 3. **(10%)** One implementation question during the demo  

> Note:  
> After `make` attacker the service ip_forward is open and send_redirects is closed, so that the ARP spoofing can work successfully.  
> The program **mitm_attack** will update the arp table of attacker immediately.   
> running command: `sudo ./mitm_attack` and  `sudo ./pharm_attack`.
